    "   In Python, an abstract superclass is a class that is intended to be subclassed but never instantiated. It provides a blueprint for its subclasses, defining a set of methods and attributes that they must implement. An abstract superclass is also known as an abstract base class (ABC) in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define an abstract superclass in Python, you can make use of the built-in module called abc (Abstract Base Classes). The abc module provides a base class called ABC which is used as a superclass for all other abstract base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define an abstract superclass, you need to inherit from the ABC class and decorate any methods that should be abstract with the @abstractmethod decorator. This decorator indicates that the method must be overridden by any subclasses."
