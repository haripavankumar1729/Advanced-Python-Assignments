    "    Exception handling is an important concept in that allows you to gracefully handle errors that may occur in \n",
    "    your program. Here are three common applications for exception processing in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input validation: When accepting input from users or external sources, it's important to validate the input to ensure \n",
    "    that it meets certain criteria. For example, if you're asking a user to enter a number, you'll want to make sure that \n",
    "    the input is actually a number and not a string. If the input doesn't meet the validation criteria, you can raise an             exception to indicate that there's a problem with the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    File I/O: Reading and writing files is a common task in Python, but it's important to handle exceptions that may occur \n",
    "    when working with files. For example, if you're trying to open a file that doesn't exist, you'll get a \n",
    "    FileNotFoundError.By handling this exception, you can display a more user-friendly message or take other actions to \n",
    "    handle the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Network communication: When working with network communication in Python, there are many exceptions that may occur, \n",
    "    such as connection errors or timeouts. By handling these exceptions, you can ensure that your program continues to \n",
    "    function properly even if there are network issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In general, exception processing is a powerful tool that allows you to handle unexpected errors in a controlled and \n",
    "    graceful manner. By anticipating potential errors and handling them appropriately, you can write more robust and \n",
    "    reliable Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Answer:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If you don't handle an exception, the program will terminate with an error message, and the stack trace \n",
    "    will be printed to the console. The error message will provide information about the type of exception that was raised, \n",
    "    as well as the line of code where the exception occurred. This can be useful for debugging, as it allows you to \n",
    "    identify the source of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, simply allowing the program to terminate with an unhandled exception is generally not desirable, as it can \n",
    "    leave the program in an inconsistent state and may cause data loss or other issues. In addition, it can be confusing \n",
    "    or frustrating for users who may not understand the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Therefore, it's important to handle exceptions appropriately in your Python code. This can involve using try/except \n",
    "    blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions, or using a more general catch-all exception handler to handle any \n",
    "    exceptions that occur. By handling exceptions in a controlled manner, you can ensure that your program remains stable \n",
    "    and reliable, even in the face of unexpected errors."

    "    specific actions to recover from the error and continue execution of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Retry the operation: Depending on the type of exception, it may be possible to retry the operation that caused the exception. For example, if a network request fails due to a connection error, you can retry the request after a short \n",
    "    delay to see if the issue has been resolved.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Rollback the transaction: If the exception occurred during a database transaction, you may need to roll back the \n",
    "    transaction to ensure that the database remains in a consistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Log the error: Even if you can't recover from the exception, it's important to log the error so that you can identify \n",
    "    and fix the underlying issue. You can use Python's logging module to log the error information to a file or other destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Display a user-friendly message: If your script is being used by end users, it may be helpful to display \n",
    "    a user-friendly message explaining the issue and providing guidance on how to resolve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    By using one or more of these recovery options, you can ensure that your script remains robust and reliable, \n",
