    "    \n",
    "    Python 3.8 introduced several new features and improvements, some of the most notable ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Assignment expressions (the walrus operator): This new operator allows you to assign and return a value in \n",
    "    a single expression. For example, instead of writing if len(some_list) > 0: item = some_list[0], you can now \n",
    "    write if (item := some_list[0]).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Positional-only parameters: This feature allows you to define function parameters that can only be passed by\n",
    "    position, not by keyword. This can make function signatures more clear and help prevent errors caused by unexpected\n",
    "    keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.f-strings now support the = operator: You can now use the = operator inside f-strings to specify the format of \n",
    "    a value. For example, f'{x=}' will output the value of x along with its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.typing.TypedDict: This new class allows you to define dictionaries with specific keys and value types, making it\n",
    "    easier to work with structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5.Performance improvements: Python 3.8 includes several optimizations that can improve the performance of your code,             especially for certain types of operations like dictionary lookups and function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6.Improved datetime module: The datetime module now includes a new zoneinfo module that provides improved timezone\n",
    "    support, including support for more accurate timezone offsets and more up-to-date timezone data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7.Debug information in traceback objects: Traceback objects now include additional information that can make it\n",
    "    easier to debug errors, including the values of local variables at the point where an exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "    These are just some of the new features in Python 3.8, there are many more smaller changes and improvements as well."
