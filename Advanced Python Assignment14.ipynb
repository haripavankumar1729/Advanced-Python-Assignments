    "    1. Wrapper: A wrapper is a function or a class that takes an existing function or class as input and provides \n",

    "    The wrapped feature is the original code that is being modified or extended by the wrapper. The wrapper can access \n",
    "    the wrapped feature and modify its behavior as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Decorator: A decorator is a special type of wrapper that uses the \"@\" syntax in Python to modify the behavior of\n",
    "    a function or class. A decorator is a function that takes a function or class as input, and returns a modified \n",
    "    version of the same function or class. Decorators are commonly used to add logging, caching, or authentication to \n",
