    "    They are applied to the class definition using the \"@decorator\" syntax. Class decorators are a simpler mechanism \n",

    "    The main difference between class decorators and metaclasses is that class decorators are applied after the \n",
    "    class has been defined, while metaclasses are involved in the creation of the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Class decorators can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as adding methods, attributes or descriptors to \n",
